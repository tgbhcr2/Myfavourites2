        <h2>My Favourite Hobby<br><span id="hobby">Playing Cricket</span></h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Cricket is my favourite game, which I like to play when I am free. Playing Outdoor game like Cricket helps me to be fit and healthy. Playing Games Outdoor also boosts our immunity. As Cricket is a team game, I like to play along with my friends. I enjoy a lot when I play with my friends. I stay in a community, so there are many children here to play together. Sometimes we do play other game with everyone. We have lot of fun playing together.But in the lockdown I have left with only 2 Friends.(very sad).</p>
